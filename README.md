# Team-Profile-Generator

Description
- Being able to generate a team profile:
- There are 3 types of profiles that can de assigned:
     - Intern 
     -Manager
     - Engineer 

Once the profile is created we are able to see it on the html file.

First you will be prompt with a questionaire on the terminal about information it needs to create the profile. 
After completing the questionaire it will generate the HTML when clicked to view. 

I will be showing a demonstration of my code in this video:
